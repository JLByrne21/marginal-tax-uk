# UK Marginal Tax

I put this simple site together as I was interested in building some of the calculations for the UK tax system myself. The site isn't perfect and was put together quickly, but it's interesting to see how high taxes can get for earners in the UK with a student loan!

Currently the graph considered, income tax, national insurance, and plan 2 student loans.

I did consider adding some of the following factors and may come back to them in the future:
- Gradual loss of child benefit between £60,000 and £80,000
- Loss of weekly free childcare hours if you earn over £100,000
- Gradual loss of maximum yearly tax free pension contributions between £260,000 and £360,000

Either way this graph will probably look different after the upcoming budget! I'll probably add more graphs here if I find more things worth adding.
